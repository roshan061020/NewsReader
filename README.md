# News Reader App

## Overview

The **News Reader App** is a simple and scalable iOS application that allows users to fetch, browse, filter, and bookmark news articles from a public API. Itâ€™s designed with a modular structure and follows modern development best practices. Users can view articles, bookmark their favourites, and filter news by categories. It uses **MVVM architecture**, **CoreData** for persistence, and **SwiftUI** for the user interface.

## Features

- Display a list of news articles with titles, descriptions, and thumbnails (when available).
- Filter news by categories. 
- Pagination support for infinite scrolling of large datasets.
- Has a page size of 8 articles and loads more on tap of load more button.
- Bookmark functionality to save articles for future reading using CoreData.
- Smooth transitions between article lists and detailed views.
- In-app WebView for reading full articles.

## Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, which separates the UI from the business logic and data fetching, allowing for better scalability and testability. It uses **CoreData** for storing bookmarked articles and **URLSession** for networking.

- **Model**: Defines the data structure for news articles and bookmarks.
- **ViewModel**: Handles data fetching, filtering, and managing states for the views.
- **View**: Displays data in the UI using SwiftUI. Views are updated automatically based on changes in the ViewModel's state.

## Key Technologies

- **Swift**: The primary language used to build the app.
- **SwiftUI**: Used for building the UI in a declarative style.
- **CoreData**: Used to persist articles and bookmark information.
- **URLSession**: For handling network requests to fetch news articles from the API.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns between the UI and business logic.
- **SOLID Principles**: Ensuring clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
